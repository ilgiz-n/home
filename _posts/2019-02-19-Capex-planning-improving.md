Как заработать на повышении качества планирования капитальных затрат
====================================================================

февраля 15, 2019

On February 5, Rosneft published its financial report for the year 2018, resulting in a [market capitalization growth of over 4%](https://www.vedomosti.ru/business/news/2019/02/05/793347-rosneft-podorozhala-posle-publikatsii) on that day. In my humble opinion, the company has the potential for capitalization growth through the implementation of measures to reduce the level of unfinished construction (NUC).

**Part 1. Measuring the quality of capital expenditure planning.**

A couple of years ago, I had to conduct a small study on improving the quality of capital expenditure planning. To achieve this, it was proposed to integrate estimate data (cost, labor and material resources, physical volumes) with the network schedule of the construction project. The plan was to use both planned data from estimates and actual data from work completion certificates. Additionally, specialized software was found and tested to automate this process.

During the study, the question arose of how to measure the economic effect that could result from improving the quality of capital expenditure planning and, of course, which indicator should be chosen to assess the effectiveness of the measures taken.

It is known that the reduction of assets under construction (AUC) is achieved through:

-   Improving the planning of capital investments and subcontracting works.
-   Ensuring uninterrupted material and technical support.
-   Timely development and delivery of project and estimate documentation to the contractor.

Therefore, we can assume that improving the quality of capital expenditure planning should lead to a reduction in AUC.

In my opinion, the indicator for this could be the ratio of the volume of unfinished construction works to capital expenditures (AUC/CE), a measure that reflects how many rubles of unfinished construction works correspond to one ruble of capital investments and also characterizes the average duration of construction projects in the company. In fact, this is an indicator of unfinished construction works previously used in the USSR. The normative values of this indicator depending on the industry, the duration of construction projects, are presented in VSN 411-81 "Norms of reserves in construction by sectors of the national economy."

**Part 2. How much can the level of AUC be reduced?**

To calculate the economic effect, it is necessary to calculate the current and target AUC/CE ratios. While the current ratio can be calculated quite easily based on the available data in the reports, determining the target ratio according to SN 411-81 would require estimating the average calculated duration of construction projects, which in turn requires data on the capacities of the facilities under construction and the normative construction periods for these capacities. Due to the lack of such data, it was decided to calculate the industry average indicator based on a sample of 13 large international oil and gas companies.

The following are comparisons of the average AUC/CE values for the period 2012-2016 (Figure 1) with other oil and gas companies reporting according to IFRS standards, as well as the dynamics of these values specifically for Rosneft for the period 2009-2018 (Figure 2).

Thus, theoretically, the AUC/CE ratio can be reduced at least to the industry average (median) value of 147%, and ideally - to 100%.

**Part 3. Economic effect for shareholders.**

We understand that inefficient (exceeding target values) volumes of AUC represent frozen financial resources that could have been temporarily uninvested or timely converted into working fixed assets.

At the same time, if the amount of capital investments is maintained, then reducing the level of AUC/CE to target levels results in a positive economic effect in the form of additional company value.

The assessment of value is based on discounted cash flow calculations assuming a reduction in the AUC/CE ratio to target values over a 5-year period and maintaining the same level of capital investments.

It is important to note that these calculations are based on various assumptions and estimations, and the actual economic effect may vary depending on the specific circumstances and execution of the proposed measures.

**Conclusion.**

In conclusion, the reduction of unfinished construction works through improved capital expenditure planning has the potential to generate a positive economic effect by increasing the value of the company. However, it requires careful implementation and monitoring of the proposed measures.
