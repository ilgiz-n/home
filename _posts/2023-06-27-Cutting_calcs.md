Hello, there! üëã

I hope you're all doing well and enjoying your professional journey. Today, I wanted to share some useful resources that allow you to optimize your material usage and save time and resources. Check them out:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Opticutter - Linear Cut List Calculator: Website: [https://www.opticutter.com/linear-cut-list-calculator](https://www.opticutter.com/linear-cut-list-calculator)

Opticutter is a versatile cutting optimization tool that solves both 1D (linear) and 2D (sheets) cutting optimization problems. Opticutter can assist you in finding the most efficient cutting patterns for various materials. While the free plan is available, it does have limits, specifically a maximum number of all required parts set at 500. For more extensive cutting operations, they offer premium plans to meet your needs.

2Ô∏è‚É£ SmartCut Pro: Website:¬†<https://smartcut.pro/>

SmartCut Pro is a cutting optimization tool that specializes in 1D cutting optimization, limits for the number of required parts are not specified. While the basic functions of the tool are available for free. With a Pro account, you can access the best calculation algorithm, set the width of the blade, view waste, use the names of parts in the calculations, and even utilize the tool's API capabilities.¬†

3Ô∏è‚É£ Cutlist Workbench: Website:¬†<https://bland.ltd/cutlist/>

Cutlist Workbench Calculator is a valuable cutting optimization tool that focuses on solving 1D cutting problems. The best part is that it is completely free to use. While the limits are not specified.

These tools are designed to assist you in finding the most efficient cutting patterns, reducing waste, and ultimately improving your bottom line. Whether you work in woodworking, textiles, pipes, rebar rods, beams or any other industry that involves cutting materials, these calculators can be valuable assets to your workflow.

üì¢ In my next post, I'll delve into the theory behind the cutting stock problem and showcase how you can create your own cutting calculator using Python. Understanding the underlying concepts and being able to implement them in a programming language like Python can provide you with even greater flexibility and customization. If you're interested in understanding the underlying principles and applying them practically, stay tuned!

Feel free to share these useful links with your network, and let's all strive for smarter cutting practices together!
